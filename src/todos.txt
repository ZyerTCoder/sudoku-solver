- add functions to manipulate candidates on displayed board
- add sudoku solving tech

- add export sudoku button with timed modal saying "copied to clipboard"
- add a scrollbar to the load sudoku modal for when you have too many options

- exampleSudokus should just be a json file
- adding paste event listeners on the modal shouldnt be done on Modal.vue
since it is meant to be reused by every modal in the app, solution would be
adding these via app.vue (not ideal) or making a second modal, SudokuPickerModal
which extends from Modal.vue
- add escape as a possible closing method for modals
